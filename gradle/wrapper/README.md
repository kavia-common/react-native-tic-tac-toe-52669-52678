# Gradle Wrapper (placeholder)

This repository is an **Expo-managed** React Native project.

A full native Android project (including the real Gradle wrapper files like
`gradle-wrapper.jar` and a functional `gradlew`) is generated by running:

```bash
cd tic_tac_toe_frontend
npm run prebuild:android
```

If CI tries to run `./gradlew` at the repo root and fails, that indicates the
native Android project has not been generated in the environment.
